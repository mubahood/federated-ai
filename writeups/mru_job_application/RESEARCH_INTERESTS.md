## Current Research

**Title:** A Blockchain-Secured Federated Learning System for Detection and Early Warning of Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Ugandan Cattle Farms

**Motivation:** Uganda's livestock sector faces devastating FMD outbreaks while veterinary data sits isolated across 50+ districts. Centralized ML models collapse when climate patterns shift (accuracy drops from 92% to 46%). A federated approach enables continuous learning across districts without sharing raw data, while blockchain governance ensures trust and accountability.

**Key Research Questions:**
1. How can blockchain verification be made lightweight enough for resource-constrained FL environments?
2. What aggregation strategies best tolerate non-IID distribution shifts in livestock disease data?
3. How do privacy budgets (differential privacy) affect prediction accuracy in the FMD domain?
4. Can verifiable incentive mechanisms sustain participation across Ugandan district veterinary offices?
