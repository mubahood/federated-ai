% ---- SALUTATION ----
Dear Sir/Madam,

% ---- BODY ----
I wish to apply for the position of \textbf{Manager, Information Systems} at Muteesa I Royal University. I have over five years of experience building and managing information systems, and I believe I would be a strong fit for this role.

I formerly served as a \textbf{Senior Full-Stack Developer at Eight Tech Consults Ltd}, where I led development of national-scale systems including the \textbf{Uganda Livestock Identification and Traceability System (ULITS)} for the Ministry of Agriculture, \textbf{School Dynamics}---an education management platform used by 46 schools---and hospital management and wildlife database systems. This work has given me practical hands-on experience in database administration, server management, API development, mobile apps, and end-user training.

I hold a \textbf{BSc in Computer Science and Engineering} from the Islamic University of Technology (Bangladesh) and am pursuing an \textbf{MSc in Computer Science} at Makerere University, researching blockchain-based federated learning.

What draws me to MRU is its momentum---recently chartered, expanding its STEAD faculty, and clearly investing in innovation. I would like to bring my experience with e-portals, learning platforms, and IT infrastructure to help strengthen MRU's digital systems and support its growth.

My CV is enclosed. I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to hearing from you.

% ---- CLOSING ----
Yours faithfully,
