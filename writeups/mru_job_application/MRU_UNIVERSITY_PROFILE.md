MRU was inspired and motivated by **Ssabasajja Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi II**, with strong support from the Executive Committee of the Buganda Kingdom led by the Katikkiro. The preparatory work was carried out by the **Buganda University Task Force (BUTF)**, inaugurated on 8 June 2004, which submitted its final report on 2 December 2004.
