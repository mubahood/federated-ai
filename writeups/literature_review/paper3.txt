SUMMARY
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that is gaining traction in view of
increasing health data privacy protection needs. By conducting a systematic review of FL applications in
healthcare, we identify relevant articles in scientiﬁc, engineering, and medical journals in English up to August
31st, 2023. Out of a total of 22,693 articles under review, 612 articles are included in the ﬁnal analysis. The
majority of articles are proof-of-concepts studies, and only 5.2% are studies with real-life application of
FL. Radiology and internal medicine are the most common specialties involved in FL. FL is robust to a variety
of machine learning models and data types, with neural networks and medical imaging being the most com-
mon, respectively. We highlight the need to address the barriers to clinical translation and to assess its real-
world impact in this new digital data-driven healthcare scene.
INTRODUCTION
With the explosion of big data, rapid development in machine
learning,
and
increasing
global
connectivity,
collaborative
training of machine learning models across different organiza-
tions and countries is at an unprecedented level.1 The biggest
concern with collaborative training in healthcare is data privacy
concerns, which limit data sharing and the clinical implementa-
tion of what is technically possible.2–4 Hence, there is increasing
focus on privacy-preserving approaches such as federated
learning (FL), blockchain technology, and generative adversarial
networks. FL is a distributed machine learning framework intro-
duced by Google in 20165 that allows for multi-party collabora-
tion while preserving data privacy. It has been gaining traction
in the medical ﬁeld as an attractive privacy-enhanced alternative
to traditional centralized training.1,6 FL has been shown to remain
robust to multiple data types including imaging, such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) for brain tumor segmentation7; chest
X-ray for COVID-19 clinical outcome prediction8; electronic med-
ical records for predicting hospitalization9; colored photographs,
such as skin photographs in skin lesion diagnostics10 and retinal
fundus photographs11; and histology slides, such as in cancer
diagnosis,12 genomics,13 and Internet of Medical Things.14
In the original FL framework, a centralized server broadcasts
initial weights of the global model parameters to a set of selected
participating site. Each participating site then trains a local
model (shares the same model architecture with the global
model) using its local data and sends updated model parameters
to the centralized server. In this setup, raw data never leave the
local device or site, thus addressing the shortcoming of tradi-
tional centralized learning where raw data are transferred to a
central body (Figure 1). Once all participating sites have sent
their updates, the server then aggregates them to update the
global model weight. The updated global model is then broad-
casted to a new set of participating sites for another round of
local training processes. The process is repeated until the global
model converges. The main advantage of FL is the generation of
a higher-quality model by leveraging larger training datasets
obtained from multiple sources, beyond what could have been
achieved with the data of a single device or a system, while main-
taining high levels of data privacy. The framework also minimizes
data aggregation costs. In addition, it has been shown to remain
robust in scenarios where clients have an uneven amount of data
and non-independent and identically distributed (IID) data.6 This
makes FL an appealing machine learning subﬁeld in the health-
care domain and especially advantageous in niche research
areas where publicly available data are limited or restricted.
Despite its advantages, FL has yet to achieve widespread clin-
ical adoption, and efforts to increase clinical translation are
ongoing.15 Aside from being a relatively newer privacy-preserving

technology, research assessing the robustness of FL across a
breadth of clinical domains and comparisons with existing ma-
chine learning frameworks are still ongoing.16 In addition, while
FL provides greater privacy protection, the sharing of model up-
dates still represents a potential source of privacy compromise.
This has led to the addition of further privacy mechanisms such
as differential privacy and cryptographic methods (homomorphic
encryption, secure multi-party computation, and blockchain) in
newer FL models.
Hence, in this study, we perform a comprehensive systematic
review on the current applications of FL in the healthcare
domain, evaluate the barriers to widespread clinical adoption,
and provide insights into future directions of FL-related health
research.
Methods
Systematic review
We conducted a systematic review to determine the current ap-
plications of FL, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines.17
(Table S1). We aimed to identify all original research articles
focusing on the use of FL in the healthcare domain. At the time
of systematic review, there were not yet universal reporting
guidelines for FL research, especially in the healthcare domain;
thus, search deﬁnitions were kept broad to avoid omission of
relevant articles.
Search strategy and selection criteria
A systematic search using PubMed, Medline, Web of Science,
Scopus, Embase, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engi-
neers Xplore, ArXiv, Springerlink, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library,
and Google Scholar was conducted. We included publications
in the English language, from inception up to August 31st,
2023. Within medical databases such as PubMed (including
Medline) and Embase, the search was conducted using Boolean
operators ‘‘AND/OR’’ and a combination of the keywords ‘‘feder-
ated learning’’ and ‘‘decentralized machine learning’’ in the title,
abstract, and medical subject headings (Table S2). The CINAHL
database included nursing and allied health journals, and the
search term ‘‘federated learning [all ﬁelds]’’ OR ‘‘decentralized
machine learning [all ﬁelds]’’ was kept broad in view of a relatively
smaller database.
Searches within non-medical databases such as Web of Sci-
ence, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ArXiv, ACM Digital Library, and
Springer Link included a combination of terms such as ‘‘feder-
ated learning [title/abstract]’’ AND ‘‘healthcare [in text] OR ‘‘med-
ical [in text]’’ (Table S2). In addition, we searched Google Scholar
to identify original research articles located in gray literature. The
following search term was used in Google Scholar database:
‘‘federated learning’’ OR ‘‘distributed machine learning’’ AND
‘‘health’’ OR ‘‘medical.’’ Further literature search consisted of re-
viewing the reference lists of relevant articles. This adopted
strategy identiﬁed all articles used in previous reviews.18–20
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for article selection
We included studies with the following criteria: (1) FL, (2) health-
care or medical related, (3) English language, and (4) original
research articles proposing FL applications in the healthcare
domain with or without prototype development. We excluded
studies that were (1) duplicates, (2) surveys, opinions, editorial
letters, book chapters, thesis, or conference proceedings, (3)
not peer reviewed, and (4) did not have full text available. The
article selection process is detailed in Figure 2. First, duplicate
articles were removed with the use of Rayyan. Second, titles
and abstracts were screened, and irrelevant articles were
excluded. Third, the full texts of the remaining articles were as-
sessed for eligibility. Based on the above criteria, two reviewers
(Z.L.T. and L.J.) independently selected the studies for ﬁnal in-
clusion. Disagreements between the two were resolved and
adjudicated by the senior author (D.S.W.T.).
Data abstraction
A standardized data extraction spreadsheet using Microsoft
Excel was used to collect information on each article. To ensure
consistency in data abstraction, a data abstraction pilot was ﬁrst
performed by both reviewers. A list of studies consisting of 20%
of all identiﬁed full-text reports was created with a computer-
generated random sequence. Independent data charting was
done by both reviewers for the randomly selected studies, and

the results of data extraction were subsequently discussed.
Disagreements were resolved by consensus between the two
reviewers and, if required, adjudicated by the senior author
(D.S.W.T.). For each included article, we extracted the following
data: publication year, article type (technical design with or
without prototype, real-life clinical application studies, FL ad-
juncts, reviews), data type utilized (imaging, electronic health
records, histology slides, genomic or molecular data, colored
photographs, Internet of Things), COVID-19 relevance, technical
architecture information, and privacy mechanisms used. For
studies with real-life clinical application of FL, we further ex-
tracted data on sample size, number of participating sites, levels
of collaboration (international, regional, or local), clinical spe-
cialty, and the role of regulatory bodies involved, if any.
In detail, we deﬁned an article to be of technical design type if it
included a description of the FL model built on a framework with
or without a prototype. Studies that artiﬁcially split the data into
artiﬁcial silos to simulate a multi-site FL setting were considered
to be of technical design with a prototype. Studies that applied
FL to train a global model among multiple sites, without actual
sharing or pooling of data, were considered as real-life clinical
application studies. Studies that focused on testing adjuncts to
an FL model such as proposing a new platform for FL, testing
of veriﬁable credentials, or post-FL-processing modiﬁcations
were included as FL adjuncts.
In this study, we deﬁned FL collaboration as international if
participating sites were from different countries/regions, regional
if participating sites were from different city or states within a
country, and local if participating sites were institutions or de-
vices within a single city or state.
Technical architecture information included machine learning
models, data partitioning, and communication architecture. Ma-
chine learning models were classiﬁed as neural networks
(including artiﬁcial neural networks, recurrent neural networks,
and convolutional neural networks), support vector machines,
decision tree models, linear or logistic regression models, unsu-
pervised, and others. FL models were also classiﬁed as horizon-
tal, vertical, or transfer learning according to how the data are
partitioned. In horizontal FL data partitioning, data of different
parties (different sample) share the same feature space. In verti-
cal FL data partitioning, datasets have similar sample space but
differ in feature space. Lastly, federated transfer learning is used

when datasets differ in both sample and feature spaces, which is
often seen in collaborative multi-institution health research. We
also classiﬁed FL models according to the two major communi-
cation architecture types: centralized and decentralized. In a
centralized communication architecture, a central server re-
ceives local model updates from each party, updates the param-
eters on the global model, and sends the training results back to
each client. In a decentralized communication architecture,
communications are performed among clients, with each client
able to directly update the global model.
Data abstraction ﬁndings were categorized according to the
article type and technical architecture. In view of heterogeneity
between studies and the lack of pre-existing reporting guidelines
for FL in health, ﬁndings are presented in a narrative review
approach with descriptive statistics, and meta-analysis was
deemed unsuitable. Furthermore, the majority of articles were
published in engineering journals with a focus on technical
design of FL models, thus precluding the assessment of risk of
bias within and across included studies typically performed in
a medical systematic review and meta-analysis.
RESULTS
Figure 2 shows the article selection process for studies included
in the review. In brief, a total of 24,060 individual records were
identiﬁed during the initial search, of which 778 articles were
selected after title and abstract screening. After further reviewing
the full text of these selected articles, 612 articles were included
in the ﬁnal analysis (Table S3).
Global trend of FL in health research
Across the world, FL research was conducted in 64 regions, with
China and the US having the highest numbers of studies at 178
and 140, respectively (Figure 3). Themajority of articles were pub-
lished in multi-disciplinary scientiﬁc journals (43.6%, 267 out of
612), followed by engineering and computer science journals
such as IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library (34.8%; 213 out of
612) and, lastly, medical journals (21.6%: 132 out of 612). All ar-
ticles included were found to be published after 2018 with an
exponential trend (Figure 4) in the number of relevant articles
across the last few years, with 1 article (0.2% of all included arti-
cles in this analysis) published in 2018, 10 (1.6%) in 2019, 38
(6.2%) in 2020, 124 (20.3%) in 2021, 186 (14.1%) in 2022, and
253 (41.3%) published in the ﬁrst three-quarters of 2023 alone.
Even though the majority of articles were published after 2020,
only a minority (16.0%) were COVID-19 related.
Out of all studies, only a minority of 5.2% (32 out of 612) were
studies with real-life application of FL. A large majority of articles
provided a technical FL framework with a prototype (65.0%, 398
out of 612) or without a prototype (17.0%, 104 out of 612). For the
remaining articles, 3.8% (23 out of 612) were on FL adjuncts, and
9.0% (55 out of 612) were review papers on the use of FL in health.
Among all articles excluding reviews, a wide variety of data
types were utilized for FL, as shown in an evidence map (Fig-
ure 5)—medical imaging data (including MRI, computed tomog-
raphy, ultrasound, and X-rays) were the most common data type
(41.7%), followed by clinical data and electronic medical records
(23.7%), Internet of Things (13.6%), data from colored images
(such as skin photographs and digital retinal photographs)
(3.6%), histology slides (2.7%), genomic data (2.3%), or a com-
bination of the above (6.8%). 1.6% of the studies did not provide
information on the data type used. FL was conducted among a
large variety of medical specialties, with radiology and internal
medicine being the most common. Figure 6 shows the distribu-
tion of studies across data types and medical specialties in FL
health research.

Technical architecture of studies
With regards to the technical architecture of the FL framework, a
large variety of machine learning models were used across
studies, excluding reviews (n = 577). Neural networks were the
most popular machine learning model, with 76.3% (440 out of
57) of the included studies using some form of neural network
in its FL model (Figure 7). Among neural networks, 67.7% used
convolutional neural networks, 24.8% used artiﬁcial neural net-
works such as multi-layer perceptron and feedforward neural
networks, and 7.5% used recurrent neural networks. Linear or
logistic regression models were the second most common
type, used in 46 out 577 (8.0%) studies. 3.5% of studies used de-
cision trees, 3.5% used support vector machines, and 1.9%
used other machine learning models including unsupervised
methods. Out of the three forms of data partitioning in FL, hori-
zontal data partitioning was the most common and was used
in 511 studies; 23 studies used vertical data partitioning, and
24 studies used transfer learning (Figure 7). A large majority of
the articles (83.7%, 483 out of 577) used a centralized communi-
cation architecture, while 10.6% (61 out of 577) were decentral-
ized (Figure 7). Out of the 577 studies with at least a technical
design, 160 (27.7%) included at least one privacy mechanism
such as differential privacy (59 studies), homomorphic encryp-
tion (29 studies), secure multi-party computation (12 studies),
or blockchain (60 studies).
While the majority of studies focused on presenting the tech-
nical details of FL, 34.3% (198 out of 557) of the studies
compared the FL model with the centralized learning model.
The majority of these studies found FL models to have compara-
ble results with their centralized counterpart.
Studies with real-life application of FL
An additional analysis among the 32 studies with real-life appli-
cation of FL was performed to evaluate the efﬁcacy of FL in
real-world settings and to provide greater insight into the clinical
translation of FL. More than half of the studies involved interna-
tional or regional collaboration. Regional collaboration was the
most common, with 14 studies (43.8%) performing FL among
sites from different cities and states. International collaboration
was seen in 11 studies, and four studies featured local collabo-
ration, while three studies kept details on geographical location
of their participating sites private. The number of participating
sites or devices in each study ranged from 2 to 314 and varied
in technical architecture (Table S3). A wide variety of clinical spe-
cialties were involved in these FL studies, with the top three spe-
cialties involved being radiology followed by oncology and urol-
ogy. Nearly all studies were intended for clinical application
except for three studies with a pharmaceutical development
application.21–23
Neural network was the most common machine learning
model (81%.3) among these studies with real-life application of
FL, while the remaining minority used logistic regression and
support vector machine. A variety of machine learning frame-
works were used, with the most common being PyTorch (9 out
of 32) followed by Tensorﬂow (8 out of 32). Three studies used
Keras, two of which were used in conjunction with Tensorﬂow.
Two studies that did not use neural networks used MATLAB.
Ten studies did not name the machine learning framework
used. Details on the cloud service were limited, with three
studies using Google Cloud, three using Amazon Web Services,
one using Microsoft Azure, and one using a private cloud service.
In most FL frameworks, especially that of a centralized
communication architecture where a central server is involved,
aggregation of model parameters should be supervised by reg-
ulatory authority. Within the federation, all clinical studies ap-
pointed a hospital trust network or a single institution leading
the FL training as the regulatory authority. However, details on
the regulatory role were limited, and none of the studies
described inventorship contribution or intellectual property
rights distribution between different participating sites.
DISCUSSION
This systematic review provides a summary of the current state
of research on FL in healthcare. The majority of studies were
found in engineering and science journals, with a minority of
21.6% found in medical journals. Importantly, only 5.2% of
studies included real-world clinical application of FL, suggesting
that the clinical use of FL in the healthcare domain is still in its
relative infancy. This is supported by the exponential rise in
health-related FL studies over the years (Figure 3), suggesting
that FL in the medical domain is increasingly gaining popularity.
COVID-19 provided a strong push toward digitalization of health
data and demonstrated the utility of FL in a global health crisis.
Early works by Dou et al.24 and Bai et al.25 showed that FL al-
lowed for secure multi-site collaboration for COVID-19 research,
especially in early stages where COVID-19 data were scarce. A
few years after the onset of COVID-19, there remain an exponen-
tially rising number of non-COVID-19-related FL studies, sug-
gesting that the privacy-enhanced data-sharing strength of FL
has widespread application beyond COVID-19. FL will likely
remain relevant in the post-pandemic global health scene.
Our review showed that FL remained robust to a variety of ma-
chine learning models, with neural networks, especially convolu-
tional neural networks, being the predominant model used. This
correlates with the predominant data type used in current FL
research, imaging, where deep convolutional neural networks

have been shown to given excellent performance.26 In addition,
the large variety of data types—both structured and unstruc-
tured data—successfully used in FL models is encouraging.
Key strengths and limitations
This review has a few strengths. First, it provides a comprehen-
sive systematic review of FL with the inclusion of a large number
of studies. Second, the database search included not only med-
ical journals but spanned across engineering, scientiﬁc, and
generic journals, where many FL models designed for healthcare
were found. This is especially important given the relative infancy
of FL, where technical papers are the large majority. Third, the
classiﬁcation of different studies allows for the identiﬁcation of
areas that require further research to increase the real-world clin-
ical application of FL. Limitations of this review include the lack of
standardized research reporting, especially on the technical
components of the FL framework, thus limiting comparison
across studies precluding useful meta-analysis. We attempted
Figure 5. Evidence map on the data variety
used across article types
to reduce bias in the review process by
having training and agreement between
the two independent reviewers based on
an initial pool of articles. Subsequently, a
standardized data collection form was uti-
lized with standardized deﬁnitions of terms,
especially regarding technical architecture
and results. In addition, non-peer-reviewed
literature was excluded during the article
selection process to increase robustness
of the review amid balancing contemporary
insights into the current state of healthcare-
related FL.
Current barriers to clinical
implementation and future
directions
The limited number studies on real-world
clinical application of FL suggests that
clinicalimplementationof FLis not yetwide-
spread. There are several barriers to clinical
adoption of FL that must be addressed.
First, FL models are still at risk of privacy
breaches. While raw data remain private in
FL, model updates exchanged during the
training process can still reveal sensitive
health information. FL models are still sus-
ceptible to reconstruction attacks (where
model parameters are used to infer original
datasets) or membership inference attacks
(where attackers used model predictions to
infer if a speciﬁc individual data record was
included in the training dataset). Counter-
measures such as the use of differential pri-
vacy where noise is added to prevent infer-
ence attacks and homomorphic encryption to allow computation
on encrypted data without decryption will confer higher levels of
data security. While raw data are not transferred, FL is still sus-
ceptible to privacy leakages during the transfer of model updates
and weights between nodes and servers. The addition of block-
chain can further enhance security during the transfer of model
updates governed by smart contracts, allowing for full decentral-
ization and enhanced security. Beyond and prior to the medical
setting, FL is widely used in other commercial sectors including
banking and ﬁnance, manufacturing, energy industry, and ecom-
merce with guidelines on the use of machine learning models in
trusted research environments27 and rapid updates in the FL
framework to enhance security and performance. These up-
dated FL strategies such as defense to model-poisoning attacks
and adversarial attack simulations can be applied to the medical
domain as well.
Second, in addition to the use of non-IID health data, the
inability to directly check and ‘‘clean’’ in an FL framework may

compromise model performance. It is known that quality of
data—in the form of large, well-labeled, and diverse data-
sets—is a key determinant of machine learning model perfor-
mance, especially in real-world settings.28 Research to explore
solutions such as data normalization before training or adapting
the FL model to heterogeneous data is ongoing. Third, explain-
ability of the FL model may be challenging due to the lack of
direct access to original data. Explainability is key in medical di-
agnostics and is essential for clinician and patient acceptance of
the FL model. Fourth, the FL framework requires that all local
participating sites have the necessary infrastructure and
computational capabilities for model training as well as access
to the communication network for model update sharing. In an
FL setting, the central server does not have control over individ-
ual nodes, which may go ofﬂine either intentionally or due to
unreliable infrastructure and networks. This may be disruptive
to the model training process. Several articles have suggested
modiﬁcations to the FL framework such as the central server se-
lecting clients based on availability and resources29,30 or the use
of blockchain for decentralization and avoidance of single-point
failure problems.31
Fifth, self-sufﬁcient sites with large amounts of diverse data
may feel little incentive to participate in the federation. The ability
to weigh contributions of each participating site and design a fair
incentive mechanism will be required to attract participants with
high-quality data to join the FL network. In addition, intellectual

property considerations have not yet been well addressed. Dur-
ing the FL training process, technology transfer is inevitable, and
intellectual property is important to determine ownership and
further incentivize participation. For successful FL networks,
we recommend that organizations identify the key regulatory
body—which may be in the form of an established government
regulatory authority, health or research institution boards/coun-
cils, or established academies or colleges of medicine and
health. This regulatory body will provide leadership over all FL
nodes, establish guidelines for standardized protocols and hard-
ware/software infrastructures among nodes, and maintain regu-
latory oversight and adherence to ethical and legal requirements.
The FL network should also engage in intellectual property distri-
bution discussion early and ensure that intellectual property
rights obtained are valid in all relevant participating territories,
especially in regional or international collaborations.
Lastly, health economic analyses of FL are required for the
acceptance of FL at the governance and policy levels.
Key future directions of FL-related research should aim to
address these barriers to increase widespread clinical adoption
of FL. Further research should focus on methods to (1) weigh in-
ventorship contribution and address intellectual property issues
to incentive high-quality data sharing and larger sites to join the
federation; (2) boost privacy mechanisms such as the use of dif-
ferential privacy, homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party
computation, and blockchain; (3) explore explainability methods
of FL models to increase acceptance from clinicians and pa-
tients; (4) develop standardized pipelines for data collection
and feature extraction to improve data quality and model perfor-
mance; (5) develop guidelines for participating nodes to acquire
sufﬁcient hardware and software infrastructure capabilities; and

The gradual yet inevitable shift away from traditional data
sharing has made it imperative for us to focus on privacy-preser-
ving technologies such as FL. This systematic review provides a
comprehensive overview of the current state of FL and acts as a
foundation for future FL research. We strongly believe that FL
holds great potential in this new era of data-driven digital health,
and future works to address the barriers will make FL a pivotal
strategy for global health collaboration.
