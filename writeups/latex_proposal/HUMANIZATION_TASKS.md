# Humanization Tasks - Research Proposal Alignment

## Analysis of User's Writing Style
- Direct, conversational academic tone
- Uses analogies ("It is like making it mandatory for any student to be able to learn; they must first physically go to the library")
- Personal pronouns: "My research", "I will", "I propose"
- Simple, clear explanations without over-technicality
- Shorter, focused sections
- Questions to engage reader: "how can we trust..."
